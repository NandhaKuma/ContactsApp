# ContactsApp

Phase 1:

Listing Screen:

The app will feature a listing screen with two tabs: one for random contacts and another for phone contacts.
Random contacts will be fetched from the provided API, displaying details such as gender, name, picture, phone, cell, id, and email. Pagination will be implemented to load more than 25 results.
Phone contacts will be fetched from the device, with the app requesting permission from the user to access contacts.
The list will display the first name, last name, and profile image of contacts.
Details Screen:

Selecting a contact from either the random or phone contacts list will open a details screen.
This screen will elegantly display essential contact details.
Phase 2:

Global Offline Search:

The app will include a global search feature that searches both random and phone contacts, even when offline.
Create and Edit Contact Feature:

Users will be able to add and edit contacts using a single screen, with fields pre-populated for editing.
The create screen will utilize multi-window functionality, opening in a new window.
Additional Features:

Adaptive UI will ensure the app's compatibility with all devices, with a dual-panel layout in landscape orientation and on large-screen devices like foldables and tablets.
Support for Material dynamic theme with dark mode, including an adaptive icon, will be integrated.
The app will maintain its state during configuration changes, such as orientation and theme adjustments.
